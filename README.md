# contactsapp
App with sign in, sign up and registration form.<br>
The app can be run by creating a local host in three simple steps <br><br>
STEP 1 <br><br>
Download XAMPP using the link provided - https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/8.1.2/xampp-windows-x64-8.1.2-0-VS16-installer.exe <br>
(The above link is for windows, for Mac or linux please go the website - apachefriends.org/index.html) <br>
and then install XAMPP in local disk c:/ <br> 
and then run XAMPP and start - 'Apache' and 'MySql'. <br><br>
STEP 2 <br><br>
Copy the .php files provided in the 'contact' folder and paste it inside the htdocs folder which is inside the xampp folder which is in localdisk c:/ <br>
C:\xampp\htdocs <br>
Now copy the 'form' folder as a whole into the 'data' folder which is inside 'mysql' folder which is indside 'xampp' folder which is in localdisk c:/ <br>
C:\xampp\mysql\data <br>
Now copy the 'ibdata1' file and paste it in the 'data' folder which is inside 'mysql' folder which is inside 'xampp' folder which is in localdisk c:/ <br>
C:\xampp\mysql\data <br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT REPLACE THE 'ibdata1' WHICH IS ALREADY PRESENT IN YOUR 'data' FOLDER, INSTEAD KEEP A COPY OF 'ibdata1' CURRENTLY PRESENT IN YOUR DEVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEN REPLACE THE 'ibdata1' IN THE 'data' FOLDER WITH THE 'ibdata1' I HAVE PROVIDED IN THIS REPOSITORY. AFTER VIEWING OF MY APPLICATION YOU SHOULD NOW REPLACE YOUR ORIGINAL 'ibdata1' IN THE 'data' FOLDER. <br><br>
STEP 3 <br><br>
Open your preferred browser and type in "localhost/login.php". The app is set and ready to function. Simple as that. :) <br>
Note: Remember XAMPP must be up and running for the localhost to work and make sure to run MySql and Apache inside XAMPP. <br>
If you want to check the database and tables and verify if the data is being stored in the database, you may click 'Admin' next to 'MySql' in XAMPP Control panel. <br>
Hope the app will work without any errors. <br>
Thank you. <br>
